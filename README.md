## Background
A well-structured `README.md` file at the root of the project repository serves as the primary source of information about the project and should be re-visited regularly.

If any of the sections cannot be completed, then the incomplete sections should be broken out into separate stories before the end of Inception.

**Note:** the _Project Brief_ and _Project Setup_ sections will be filled in via separate stories.

## Scenario: New project
Given a new project with a Github repo set up
- [ ] When I look at the root of the project
- [ ] Then I find a `README.md` file
